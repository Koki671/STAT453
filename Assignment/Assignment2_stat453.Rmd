#Question3
#The effect of three different lubricating oils on fuel economy in diesel truck engines is being
#studied. Fuel economy is measured using brake-specific fuel consumption after the engine has been
#running for 15 minutes. Five different truck engines are available for the study, and the experimenters
#conduct the following randomized complete block design.
```{r}

#3(a)Analyze the data from this experiment.

# Create a dataframe with the given data
dataFrame <- data.frame(
  Fuel_Economy = c(0.500, 0.535, 0.513, 0.634, 0.675,
                   0.595, 0.487, 0.520, 0.488, 0.329,
                   0.435, 0.400, 0.512, 0.540, 0.510), 
  Lubricant = rep(1:3, times = 5),
    Engine = rep(1:5, each = 3)

)
dataFrame


# Perform the ANOVA
aov3 <- aov(Fuel_Economy ~ factor(Lubricant) + factor(Engine), data = dataFrame)
summary(aov3)

# From the anova test above,since the p-value for Lubricant is 0.0233 which is smaller than a = 0.05,
#It is significant to explain the variability in a response variable. Also, since the p-value for truck is 1.78e-05 which is smaller than a = 0.05,
#It is significant to explain the variability in a response variable.



#3(b)Use the Tukey method to make comparisons among the three lubricating oils to determine specifically
#which oils differ in break-specific fuel consumption.

# Perform Tukey's HSD test
tukey <- TukeyHSD(aov3, "factor(Lubricant)", conf.level = 0.95)
tukey

#From the output by tukey's test, It is clear that 
#The difference between oil 1 and oil2 is significant since the p-value = 0.02458 < a = 0.05

#Question 4
# An article in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society (Vol. 139, No. 2, 1992, pp. 524-532)
#describes an experiment to investigate low-pressure vapor deposition of polysilicon. The experiment was
#carried out in a large capacity reactor at Sematech in Austin, Texas. The reactor has several wafer
#positions, and four of these positions are selected at random. The response variable is film thickness
#uniformity. Three replicates of the experiment were run, and the data are as follows:
```{r}
#(a) Is there a difference in the wafer positions? Use α=0.05. 

##Ho: σ^2=0	
#Ha: σ^2>0

# Create a data frame with the provided data
data4 <- data.frame(
  Wafer_Position = rep(1:4, each = 3),
  Uniformity = c(2.76, 5.67, 4.49, 1.43, 1.70, 2.19, 2.34, 1.97, 1.47, 0.94, 1.36, 1.65)
)
data4
# Perform one-way ANOVA
result <- aov(Uniformity ~ factor(Wafer_Position), data = data4)

# Summary of the ANOVA
summary(result)


#From the output of ANOVA table, the p-value is 0.00775 << 0.05, then we reject Ho:
#It is significant that there is differencew  between wafer positions.



#(b) Estimate the variability due to wafer position( �)*
sigmat = (5.407-0.652)/3
sigmat

#(c) Estimate the random error component ( �)().
#From the ANOVA table i can get MSB
sol = (5.407-0.652)/3
sol
#From the r output, the random error component is 0.652

#Question5 The effect of five different ingredients (A, B, C, D, E) on reaction time of a chemical process is
#being studied. Each batch of new material is only large enough to permit five runs to be made.
#Furthermore, each run requires approximately 1 1/2 hours, so only five runs can be made in one day. The
#experimenter decides to run the experiment as a Latin square so that day and batch effects can be
#systematically controlled. She obtains the data that follow. Analyze the data from this experiment (use a= 0.05) and draw conclusions.

#From the output of ANOVA table, the p-value for Batch and Day are 0.455014 and 
#0.034618 > a =  0.05, then we  fail toreject Ho.
#So these tw factors are not significant for the equation.
#It is significant that there is differencew  between wafer positions.
#On the other hand, the p-value of ingredients is 0.000488 << 0.05 = a.
#So we reject Ho. It is significant that the factor(ingredients) should be 
#significant for the equation.

#From the turkey's test, it is clear that the differences of D and A,
#E and A, D and C, and E and C are significant.

#For checking normality, I used a q-q plot. According to the q-q plot,
#almost of all data are near the streight line, so it is normally distributed.
#Also residual	vs	fitted	value	plot shows that the scatter of the data are 
#in the same pattern or similar pattern. So, the variance is also adequate.
#Moreover, the residual	vs	order	plot shows that the smilar pattern of scatter
#based on the horizontal line at  h = 0. So, independent correlation is also adequate.
